        <h1>YOUR GENERATION</h1>
        <h2>WILL NEED TO COPE WITH CONTINUED CLIMATE CHANGE.</h2>
        <p>
          It urgently needs leaders who are equipped to help society understand
          and deal with climate challenges. UCLA’s learning and research
          opportunities prepare the most empowered new leaders in science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate Science is the study of Earth’s climate with the aims of
          understanding how the climate works and predicting its future.
          Theoretical, modeling, and observational techniques are all central to
          the field. Led by UCLA’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic
          Sciences (AOS) – ranked #1 by the National Research Council – this new
          degree program is the first of its kind at one of the world’s top
          research universities.

        <h1>AS AN AOS CLIMATE SCIENCES MAJOR,</h1>
        <h2>YOU WILL GAIN THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING YOU NEED TO:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assess climate impacts from both human-induced climate change and
            natural climate variability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicate climate information to decision-makers in the public
            sector, private sector and nongovernmental organizations.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="row">
        <h1>WHAT CAN I DO</h1>
        <h2>WITH A CLIMATE SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE?</h2>
        <p>
          Your degree will give you strong science foundations with an exposure
          to policy and solutions. With its strong quantitative emphasis, the
          program is excellent preparation if you wish to pursue a graduate
          degree in nearly any scientific field, but especially Climate Science
          or an allied area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major is also applicable to careers in environmental law, policy,
          communications, think tank, or non-profit sectors.

        <h1>WHAT COURSES</h1>
        <h2>WILL I NEED TO MAJOR IN CLIMATE SCIENCE AT UCLA?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The basic math and science requirements expected of all science
            majors, including calculus, introductory physics, and introductory
            chemistry, in addition to one course each in statistics and computer
            programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Six core courses teaching the fundamentals of climate science,
            including the phenomenology of the climate system, energy flows
            within the climate system, the dynamics and thermodynamics of the
            atmosphere and ocean, biogeochemistry, and the state of knowledge of
            climate change.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two upper division climate science courses on more specialized
            topics, allowing you to tailor learning outcomes to your own
            interests and begin the process of planning your career.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two upper division courses outside the AOS department. This is
            because climate science is relevant for public policymaking, and
            because changes in the physical climate system are profoundly
            influenced by human choices. We’ll encourage you to engage in
            coursework on relevant policy issues.
